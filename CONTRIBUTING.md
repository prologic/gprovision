## Code of Conduct

You're human, we're human. Be humane. Don't be a jerk.

## Contributing

Please communicate with us before creating a pull request, either via issue or Open Source Firmware's slack.

Code must be formatted, and (of course) tests need to pass. New code needs to have tests, and the same applies to modifications of existing code.

## Developer Sign-Off

For purposes of tracking code-origination, we follow a simple sign-off
process.  If you can attest to the [Developer Certificate of
Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) then you append in each git
commit text a line such as:
```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <username@youremail.com>
```
